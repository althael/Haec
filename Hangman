/*Create a very simple hangman game. Read from the user 5 words (before storing the words, 
call the trim() method). Pick a random word and display as many underscore characters '_'
to the user, as the length of the word. Ask the user to enter a character and if the character
is found in the word, replace the '_' character in the corresponding position and show the result
to the user. If the character is not found in the word, print an error message. The user is 
allowed to make three wrong guesses. After that the they lose the game and the word is printed 
to the user. Continue until the word is revealed. At the end of a game ask the user continue,
and if they wish to continue pick another random words from the ones entered at the start of the
game. */
